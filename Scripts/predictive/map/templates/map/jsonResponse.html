{"id":"bb2d39b840666ed9","name":"New_York_Housing_Density","capabilities":"Map,TilesOnly","description":"Residential landuse for the city is shown, expressed as housing density.  Housing density is divided into three categories: high, medium, low.  Generally the data provided by each city had a code or an indicator such as \"residential high density.\" Generally, no numeric value determined the density, rather an indicator of housing zones or actual building type identified the housing type, and thus the density.  In New York, there were zones signifying areas of residential landuse, but not by density. Thus the US Census Bureau data for Total Households was used to augment the data (it was normalized by land are in square miles).  1. Use the residential land areas provided by the city 2. Clip out the Total Household information from the US Census Bureau dataset 3. Calculate the housing density by  normalizing the total households by a land area field 4. Separate the values into three classes (Jenks) in this case (make sure it is roughly the same breakpoints as in other cities that use a calculation) 5. Identify the building footprints in each class ","serviceDescription":"","server":"nGt4QxSblgDfeJn9","type":"MapServer","access":"SECURE","status":"created","initialExtent":{"xmin":-8284546.864436815,"ymin":4928235.417198292,"xmax":-8187166.090401463,"ymax":5004213.823313787,"spatialReference":{"wkid":102100,"wkt":null}},"fullExtent":{"xmin":-8266168.200300001,"ymin":4937568.234499998,"xmax":-8204259.259199999,"ymax":5000035.188100003,"spatialReference":{"wkid":102100,"wkt":null}},"spatialReference":{"wkid":102100,"wkt":null},"minScale":2311162.217155,"maxScale":9027.977411,"singleFusedMapCache":true,"tileInfo":{"rows":256,"cols":256,"dpi":96,"format":"PNG","compressionQuality":0,"storageFormat":"esriMapCacheStorageModeExploded","origin":{"x":-2.0037508342787E7,"y":2.0037508342787E7},"spatialReference":{"wkid":102100,"wkt":"PROJCS[\"WGS_1984_Web_Mercator_Auxiliary_Sphere\",GEOGCS[\"GCS_WGS_1984\",DATUM[\"D_WGS_1984\",SPHEROID[\"WGS_1984\",6378137.0,298.257223563]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0.0],UNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]],PROJECTION[\"Mercator_Auxiliary_Sphere\"],PARAMETER[\"False_Easting\",0.0],PARAMETER[\"False_Northing\",0.0],PARAMETER[\"Central_Meridian\",0.0],PARAMETER[\"Standard_Parallel_1\",0.0],PARAMETER[\"Auxiliary_Sphere_Type\",0.0],UNIT[\"Meter\",1.0],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",3857]]"},"lods":[{"level":0,"resolution":156543.03392800014,"scale":5.91657527591555E8},{"level":1,"resolution":78271.51696399994,"scale":2.95828763795777E8},{"level":2,"resolution":39135.75848200009,"scale":1.47914381897889E8},{"level":3,"resolution":19567.87924099992,"scale":7.3957190948944E7},{"level":4,"resolution":9783.93962049996,"scale":3.6978595474472E7},{"level":5,"resolution":4891.96981024998,"scale":1.8489297737236E7},{"level":6,"resolution":2445.98490512499,"scale":9244648.868618},{"level":7,"resolution":1222.992452562495,"scale":4622324.434309},{"level":8,"resolution":611.4962262813797,"scale":2311162.217155},{"level":9,"resolution":305.74811314055756,"scale":1155581.108577},{"level":10,"resolution":152.87405657041106,"scale":577790.554289},{"level":11,"resolution":76.43702828507324,"scale":288895.277144},{"level":12,"resolution":38.21851414253662,"scale":144447.638572},{"level":13,"resolution":19.10925707126831,"scale":72223.819286},{"level":14,"resolution":9.554628535634155,"scale":36111.909643},{"level":15,"resolution":4.77731426794937,"scale":18055.954822},{"level":16,"resolution":2.388657133974685,"scale":9027.977411},{"level":17,"resolution":1.1943285668550503,"scale":4513.988705},{"level":18,"resolution":0.5971642835598172,"scale":2256.994353},{"level":19,"resolution":0.29858214164761665,"scale":1128.497176}]},"documentInfo":{"title":"New_York_Housing_Density","author":"AtlasPublisher","comments":"","subject":"This map shows the housing density in New York.","category":"","keywords":"residential,  housing,  density,  New York","credits":"Esri, HERE","Title":"New York Housing Density","Author":"","Comments":"This map shows the housing density in New York.","Subject":"This map shows the housing density in New York.","Category":"","AntialiasingMode":"Best","TextAntialiasingMode":"Force","Keywords":""},"copyrightText":"Esri, HERE","tileServers":["https://tiles1.arcgis.com/tiles/nGt4QxSblgDfeJn9/arcgis/rest/services/New_York_Housing_Density/MapServer","https://tiles2.arcgis.com/tiles/nGt4QxSblgDfeJn9/arcgis/rest/services/New_York_Housing_Density/MapServer","https://tiles3.arcgis.com/tiles/nGt4QxSblgDfeJn9/arcgis/rest/services/New_York_Housing_Density/MapServer","https://tiles4.arcgis.com/tiles/nGt4QxSblgDfeJn9/arcgis/rest/services/New_York_Housing_Density/MapServer"],"maxExportTilesCount":100000,"exportTilesAllowed":false,"serviceItemId":"2d6f6624424a410a994bd9432befb907","mapName":"Layers","units":"esriMeters","supportedImageFormatTypes":"PNG","layers":[{"id":0,"name":"Buildings","parentLayerId":-1,"defaultVisibility":true,"subLayerIds":null,"minScale":100000,"maxScale":0},{"id":1,"name":"Housing Density","parentLayerId":-1,"defaultVisibility":true,"subLayerIds":null,"minScale":25000,"maxScale":0},{"id":2,"name":"Housing Density","parentLayerId":-1,"defaultVisibility":true,"subLayerIds":null,"minScale":50000,"maxScale":25001},{"id":3,"name":"Housing Density","parentLayerId":-1,"defaultVisibility":true,"subLayerIds":null,"minScale":100000,"maxScale":50001},{"id":4,"name":"Housing Density","parentLayerId":-1,"defaultVisibility":true,"subLayerIds":null,"minScale":200000,"maxScale":100001},{"id":5,"name":"Housing Density","parentLayerId":-1,"defaultVisibility":true,"subLayerIds":null,"minScale":0,"maxScale":200001}],"tables":[],"resampling":false,"currentVersion":10.51}
