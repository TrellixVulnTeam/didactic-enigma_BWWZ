                                    A large percentage of infectious disease outbreaks begin in developing countries: Sub-Saharan Africa alone accounts for 24% of the global disease burden even though only 11% of the worldâ€™s population lives there (1). Technically, outbreaks can pop up anywhere, but we know that a lot of the time they seem to start in resource poor areas. This can be for one of four reasons: 1) lack of trained medical workers, 2) poor sanitation, 3) slow reporting time, and 4) lack of data. The main problems that we here at HealthRAIS are concerned with are 3) and 4), slow reporting time and lack of data. Communication, or lack thereof, can be extremely important to the cause, and an inefficient communication network can lead to the loss of many lives.                            
                                  </p>
                                <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".7s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                    According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, on average only 28% of healthcare facilities in Sub-Saharan Africa have reliable access to electricity, and around 26% of them have no access at all. Because of this a lot of health centers rely on other means of data reporting, and this usually involves filling out paper forms and then periodically delivering them to the capital. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                To try to fill these gaps, solutions have popped up that utilize internet or even smartphone apps to try to aid the flow of communication across regions. But these "fixes" all fall short because of one fatal detail: these regions have almost no internet at all. In Sierra Leone, for example, only 4% of the population has access to the internet, according to BBC. However, around 94% of the population has access to a cell phone, and while these phones might not be the most up-to-date, high tech smartphones available on the current market, they all at least have baseline SMS capabilities. This means that around 94% of the population has access to texting, which is the mode of communication that we are aiming to utilize.

                        <p>
                            It is imperative that national-level health officials receive accurate, up-to-date data from all over their country, and this system makes it easy to send and report data with just one simple text. Using a common format, each SMS message will display three things: location, disease name, and case count. Once the platform receives this message, it will sort the information and then display it on a map, where all real-time health data can be viewed. The frequency that these health workers report information is up to the discretion of the user, but for the best results we recommend daily reports. Hourly reports may even be required in critical situations. 
                    
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With the HealthRAIS platform, governments can monitor health data from all over the country so they can be informed at all times, even when there isn't a current outbreak. In the Map system, pins pop up wherever a new case has been reported, and each region turns a different color depending on the number of reports received. The disease and date range can be chosen manually, so that the user only sees the information that they want, and different areas and cases can be clicked on to go more in depth. Concurrently, all data will also be displayed in graphs, and the user can switch between map and graph view to get the information in the way that is best for them.

                        <p>
                            The HealthRAIS platform has two alert systems: one internal and one external. With the internal alert system, more urgent health data coming in is organized and displayed at the top of the Map page to alert the user that there is abnormal activity occurring somewhere in the country. This way, when a critical situation is unfolding, the user is notified right away and no time is wasted. Another capability of this system is its external alerts feature. Using this, officials can send out notifications to registered phone numbers that a high risk situation is taking place in a neighboring area. Now, health workers in that area know to immediately report if they see certain diseases come into their hospital.

                                    <p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, on average, 26% of healthcare facilities have no access to electricity at all, and only about 28% have constant, reliable sources of electricity. Therefore, reporting  systems in these countries are often manual and paper-based, with specific data points varying between districts and clinics.  Data is often disorganized, redundant, and sometimes even nonexistent. This is makes it difficult for governments and NGOs to understand infectious disease activity throughout the country. With HealthRAIS, information is sent in a common format, and the system standardizes, analyzes, and then displays the information so that it can be viewed all at once, or grouped in whichever way desired, to give the clearest picture. Now, instead of sorting through hundreds or thousands of paper reports and reading and filing all of them by hand, the system does all this automatically so that the information is displayed in front of the user whenever required.

                                    <p>It took officials in Guinea almost three months to detec the Ebola outbreak.  By the time they noticed, it was too late; the disease had already affected about 40 people in the region, and crossed two (?) borders. It eventually affected multiple countries in 3 different regions of the world, and raged on for more than 17 months. If officials in Guinea had the data and tools to detect the outbreak in its early stages, they may have been able to stop the outbreak from becoming and epidemic.  The  HealthRAIS system continuously monitors infectious diseas activity and enables users to see outbreaks in their earliest stages.  This will allow them to make real time observations and decisions so that the next time an outbreak occurs, they can respond without delay and work to put a stop to it.
